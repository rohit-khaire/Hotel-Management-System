# Hotel-Management-System
**Overview**

The Hotel Management System is a command-line application designed to automate and simplify the process of managing customer bookings, room occupancy, and check-outs in a hotel with a 50-room capacity. This project is developed using Java and JDBC (Java Database Connectivity), with MySQL as the backend database to handle and store customer data and room booking information.

The system allows hotel staff to:
Add new customers to the hotelâ€™s database, ensuring room availability.
Track customers checking out on a particular day.
View the real-time room occupancy and manage bookings.
Delete customer records from the system.

**Features**

Customer Management:
Add new customers by collecting details such as name, age, contact information, and the number of days for booking.
Automatically assigns available rooms based on occupancy status.
Allows deleting customer records when necessary.

Room Management:
The system ensures room assignments are made dynamically, based on availability.
Prevents new bookings when the hotel has reached its maximum capacity of 50 rooms.

Check-in and Check-out Management:
Provides the functionality to display customers who are checking out on the current day.
Maintains real-time room status, showing the details of the customers occupying each room.

Validation:
The system includes input validation for customer details, ensuring proper data (e.g., valid age, contact number) is entered, improving data integrity.

**Technologies Used**

Java: The application is developed using Java to ensure portability, ease of use, and object-oriented design principles.<br>
JDBC (Java Database Connectivity): Utilized for database connection, SQL queries, and updates.<br>
MySQL: A relational database used to store customer and room booking information.<br>
LocalDate (Java): Used for handling dates (e.g., check-in/check-out dates) for better date management.<br>

**Installation**

Prerequisites:
Java & MySQL

**Steps to Run:**
